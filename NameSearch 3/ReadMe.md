I placed the focus here on the project in refactoring code on the Login and Domain sections of the application. For reusability, I wrote a network layer that all the code can reuse and refactored that in the 2 sections of the app. Unit tests were written for the LoginViewController and the new NetworkManager class along with a wide range of code clean up.
